                    <strong>Raden Saleh Sjarif Boestaman (1811 until 23 April 1880).</strong>
                    was a pioneering Indonesian Romantic painter of Arab-Javanese ethnicity. He was
                    considered to be the first "modern" artist from Indonesia (then Dutch East Indies), and his
                    paintings corresponded with nineteenth-century romanticism which was popular in Europe at the
                    time. He also expressed his cultural roots and inventiveness in his work.

                    He was born into a noble Hadhrami family where his father was Sayyid Husen bin Alwi bin Awal bin

                    who once married to Abdurrahman (father of Ali Kwitang) but gave no offsprings.

                    <p><strong>Young Raden Saleh was first taught in
                        Bogor by the Belgian artist A.J. Payen.</strong>
                      Payen acknowledged the youth's talent, and persuaded the
                      colonial government of the Netherlands to send Raden Saleh to the Netherlands to study art.
                      He
                      arrived in Europe in 1829 and began to study under Cornelius Kruseman and Andreas
                      Schelfhout.</p>

                    <p><strong>It was from Kruseman that Raden Saleh studied his skills in portraiture, and later
                        was accepted
                        at various European courts where he was assigned to do portraits.</strong> While in
                      Europe, in 1836 Saleh
                      became the first indigenous Indonesian to be initiated into Freemasonry. From 1839, he spent
                      five years at the court of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who became an important
                      patron.</p>

                    <p><strong>Schelfhout, Raden Saleh furthered his skills as a landscape painter. </strong>Raden
                      Saleh visited
                      several European cities, as well as Algiers. In The Hague, a lion tamer allowed Raden Saleh
                      to
                      study his lion, and from that his most famous painting of animal fights was created, which
                      subsequently brought fame to the artist. Many of his paintings were exhibited at the
                      Rijksmuseum
                      in Amsterdam. Several of his paintings were destroyed when the Colonial Dutch pavilion in
                      Paris
                      was burnt in 1931.</p>

                    <p><strong>Raden Saleh returned to Dutch East Indies in 1852, after living in Europe for 20
                        years.</strong> He
                      worked as conservator for the colonial collection of government art and continued painting
                      portraits of the Javanese aristocracy, and many more landscape paintings. Returning to Java,
                      he
                      expressed his uneasiness of living in the colonies, stating that "here, people only talks
                      about
                      coffee and sugar, then sugar and coffee" in one of his letters.</p>

                    <p><strong>Upon returning, Saleh built a house in Cikini (now Cikini Hospital), based on the
                        Callenberg
                        Castle where he had stayed during his European travels c. 1844. </strong>Surrounded by
                      vast grounds, most
                      of them were converted into public gardens in 1862, and were closed in the turn of the
                      century.
                      In 1960, the Taman Ismail Marzuki was built in the former gardens. The house itself is still
                      used today as a hospital.</p>

                    <p><strong> He married a young aristocratic woman of Yogyakarta Sultanate, Raden Ayu Danudirdja,
                        in 1867 and
                        subsequently moved to Bogor, where he rented a house near the Bogor Botanical Gardens
                        with a
                        view of Mount Salak. </strong>He later took his wife to travel in Europe, visiting
                      countries such as the
                      Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. His wife however contracted an illness while in
                      Paris,
                      the exact illness is still not known, and was so severe that they both immediately returned
                      to
                      Bogor. She died on 31 July 1880, following her husband's death three months earlier.</p>
